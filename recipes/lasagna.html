    <p><h3>Lasagne alla Bolognese is an institution, typical for Sunday lunches. 
        This rich and tasty dish originates from the Emilia region, specifically, from the city of Bologna. 
        Lasagna, however, is known, appreciated, made, remade, tasted and shared not only throughout Italy, 
        but also abroad as an Italian symbolic dish.

        béchamel and grated cheese.</h3></p>


        <p><h3>Obviously, lasagna has numerous and delicious variations such as the pumpkin and sausage, or the one with mushrooms, 
            perfect for autumn menus. 
            From the preparation to the ingredients, this recipe is the quintessence of the "richness" of traditional Bolognese cuisine, 
            also famous for many other fresh pasta recipes and more.
